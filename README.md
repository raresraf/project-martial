# Project Martial

The core part of our research is focused around detecting plagiarism. While there were many cases of _plagiarism_ in the history, the first documented case of using the word _plagiarius_ was during the life of the roman poet, Martial. He is considered to be the first person to claim authorship rights, in an ancient world where intellectual property and copyright lays were not enforced, when exact copies of his poems and epigrams started to appear presented as personal work by obscure writers. Project Martial is a initiative aiming to provide automatic assistance in detecting software plagiarism.
