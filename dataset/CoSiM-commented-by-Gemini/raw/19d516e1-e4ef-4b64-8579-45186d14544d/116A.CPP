/**
 * @file 116A.CPP
 * @brief A template for a competitive programming solution.
 * @details This file represents a basic C++ template often used in competitive
 * programming. It sets up a standard structure but does not contain any specific
 * logic related to a particular problem. The problem "116A" is titled "Tram", but
 * its logic is not implemented here.
 *
 * @section structure Template Structure
 * 1. `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`: This is a non-standard header file available in
 *    some compilers (like GCC) that includes most of the standard library headers.
 *    It's a common shortcut in competitive programming to avoid including many
 *    individual headers.
 * 2. `using namespace std;`: This brings all names from the `std` namespace into
 *    the global scope, another common shortcut.
 * 3. `solve()` function: An empty function intended to contain the core logic for
 *    a single test case. This promotes modularity, especially when a problem
 *    requires handling multiple test cases.
 * 4. `main()` function: The entry point of the program. It calls the `solve()`
 *    function. A typical extension would be to add a loop in `main` to call
 *    `solve()` multiple times for multiple test cases.
 *
 * @section complexity Complexity Analysis
 * - Time Complexity: O(1), as the program currently performs no significant operations.
 * - Space Complexity: O(1).
