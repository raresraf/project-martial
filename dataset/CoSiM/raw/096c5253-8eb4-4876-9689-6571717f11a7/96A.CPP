// Petya loves football very much. One day, as he was watching a football match,
// he was writing the players' current positions on a piece of paper. To simplify
// the situation he depicted it as a string consisting of zeroes and ones. A zero
// corresponds to players of one team; a one corresponds to players of another
// team. If there are at least 7 players of some team standing one after another,
// then the situation is considered dangerous. For example, the situation
// 00100110111111101 is dangerous and 11110111011101 is not. You are given the
// current situation. Determine whether it is dangerous or not.
//
// Input
// The first input line contains a non-empty string consisting of characters "0"
// and "1", which represents players. The length of the string does not exceed
// 100 characters. There's at least one player from each team present on the
// field.
//
// Output
// Print "YES" if the situation is dangerous. Otherwise, print "NO".
