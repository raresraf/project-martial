/* Those days, many boys use beautiful girls' photos as avatars in forums. So it
is pretty hard to tell the gender of a user at the first glance. Last year, our
hero went to a forum and had a nice chat with a beauty (he thought so). After
that they talked very often and eventually they became a couple in the network.

But yesterday, he came to see "her" in the real world and found out "she" is
actually a very strong man! Our hero is very sad and he is too tired to love
again now. So he came up with a way to recognize users' genders by their user
names.

This is his method: if the number of distinct characters in one's user name is
odd, then he is a male, otherwise she is a female. You are given the string that
denotes the user name, please help our hero to determine the gender of this user
by his method.

Input
The first line contains a non-empty string, that contains only lowercase English
letters   the user name. This string contains at most 100 letters.

Output
If it is a female by our hero's method, print "CHAT WITH HER!" (without the
quotes), otherwise, print "IGNORE HIM!" (without the quotes). */
